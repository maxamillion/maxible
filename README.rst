running Fedora 23 or later).

::

    git clone https://github.com/maxamillion/ansible-maxamillion-workstation.git
    cd ansible-maxamillion-workstation

    # Run this if you have Fedora 23+ (Hope you do, but nobody is perfect)
    ansible-playbook bootstrap-fedora.yml -i inventory.txt

Notes
-----
There are no dotfiles or configs included in this ansible-playbook.
Data retention is handled outside the scope of this playbook

Some of my dotfiles related to i3, i3status, dunst, and tmux are available `here
<https://github.com/maxamillion/dotfiles>`_.
